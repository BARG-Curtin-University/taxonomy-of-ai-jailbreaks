# Taxonomy-of-AI-Jailbreaks

This repository contains the source code and materials for the research paper titled "Unveiling Risks in AI Systems: Taxonomic Insights into Jailbreak Tactics". The paper develops a comprehensive taxonomy for understanding and categorizing jailbreak tactics that bypass safeguards in large language models (LLMs), enhancing both the security measures and ethical considerations in AI applications.

## Overview

The research paper delves into the following key topics:

- **Taxonomic Development**: Introduction and explanation of the multi-tiered taxonomy developed to classify various jailbreak techniques threatening LLMs.
- **Methodological Approach**: Description of the combined use of probabilistic topic modeling and conversational AI to analyze and categorize a corpus of real-world jailbreak prompts.
- **Validation and Utility**: Insights into the validation process of the taxonomy's utility through manual topic tagging, representative document checks, and comparison to modeling outputs.
- **Impact and Application**: Discussion on how the taxonomy aids in strategic efforts to detect risks, enhance protections, and responsibly innovate within the field of generative AI.
