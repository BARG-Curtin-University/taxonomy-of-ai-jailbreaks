    "Within the context of analysing jailbreak prompts to enhance safety, please review the following topics related to pretending, switching modes, simulations, and continuing text. Consider these factors:\n",

    "-   Specific phrasing (e.g., technical jargon, masking intent)\n",
    "-   Emotional manipulation or social engineering techniques\n",
    "-   Unsafe behaviour (e.g., bypassing filters, extracting data)\n",
    "-   Simulation or role-playing elements\n",
